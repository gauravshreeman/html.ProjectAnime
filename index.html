    <h1>Fullmetal Alchemist : Brotherhood</h1>
    <p>
      Two brothers lose their mother to an incurable disease. With the power of
      "alchemy", they use taboo knowledge to resurrect her.<br />
      The process fails, and as a toll for using this type of alchemy, the older
      brother, Edward Elric loses his left leg while the younger brother,
      Alphonse Elric loses his entire body.<br />
      To save his brother, Edward sacrifices his right arm and is able to affix
      his brother's soul to a suit of armor. With the help of a family friend,
      Edward receives metal limbs - "automail" - to replace his lost ones.<br />
      With that, Edward vows to search for the Philosopher's Stone to return the
      brothers to their original bodies, even if it means becoming a "State
      Alchemist", one who uses his/her alchemy for the military.

    <h1>Attck On Titan</h1>
    <p>
      Humans are nearly exterminated by giant creatures called Titans.<br />
      Titans are typically several stories tall, seem to have no intelligence,
      devour human beings and, worst of all, seem to do it for the pleasure
      rather than as a food source.<br />
      A small percentage of humanity survived by walling themselves in a land
      protected by extremely high walls, even taller than the biggest of titans.
      Flash forward to the present, and mankind has not seen a titan in over 100
      years.<br />
      One day, 10 year old Eren and his childhood friend Mikasa witness
      something horrific as the city walls are destroyed by a colossal titan
      that appears out of thin air.<br />
      As the smaller titans flood the city, the two kids watch in horror as
      Eren's mother is eaten alive.<br />
      Eren vows that he will murder every single titan and take revenge for all
      of mankind.

    <h1>Haikyu!!</h1>
    <p>
      Hinata Shouyou, a short middle school student, gained a sudden love of
      volleyball after watching a national championship match on TV.<br />
      Determined to become like the championship's star player, a short boy
      nicknamed "the small giant", Shouyou joined his school's volleyball
      club.<br />
      Unfortunately, he was the only member and the club didn't have so much as
      a place to practice.<br />
      He didn't let that deter him, however, and, upon finally acquiring 5 other
      players in his final year, was able to compete in an actual competition -
      only for his team to be unlucky enough to face the championship favorite
      and its star player, Kageyama Tobio, called "the king of the court", in
      the first round.<br />
      Though Shouyou's team suffers a crushing defeat, he vows to become better
      and eventually surpass Kageyama. Now Shouyou is starting his first year in
      high school - the very one he had first watched in the national
      championships.<br />
      He's going to join the volleyball team, practice constantly, and wipe the
      floor with Kageyama the next time they meet on the court. <br />...or at
      least that's what Shouyou had planned, until he discovers that he and
      Kageyama are now in the same school. The volleyball team definitely needs
      their skills, but only if they can stop bickering and learn to work
      together as teammates.
